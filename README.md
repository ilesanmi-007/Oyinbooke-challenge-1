# This is one out of three of Oyinbooke-challenge-1

# **Project objective:**
A company in the environmental consulting industry is seeking to analyze the air quality in a specific city during hot and cold weather,
during high-wind conditions and during precipitation. They are interested in making recommendations to the government and businesses in the
region on how to mitigate the impact of weather conditions on air quality.  

As a Data Analyst, you are expected to analyze the data provided, seek insights and make recommendations to achieve the set objectives.
Additionally, kindly use this dataset to analyze the historical impact of weather conditions on air quality, and make predictions on air
quality during specific weather conditions. This information could be used to inform emergency response plans and prepare for potential air quality issues.

## Problem Statements
1. What is the relationship between air quality and hours of rainfall
2. Average air quality by month
3. Relationshp between air quality and hours of rainfall
4. Relationship between average air qualitty and hours of snowfall
5. Average air quality during the hours of the day
6. Qualities of the Air during wind categories and Temperature categories

1. The maximum temperature in this region is 42 degree and the lowest is -19
2. Also, maximum air pollutant of 994 micro gram per cubic meter

#### *Observation:*
The increase in rainfall and snow fall actually reduces the concentration of impurities in the air, thereby causing an increase in the air quality

#### *Observation:*
1. In contrast to opinions, afternoon has the least air pollution and high at night
2. The higher the temperature, there's a varying decrease in Air concentration

#### *Observation:*
1. We have more Air concentration at calm wind than at others
2. During cold season, we have high Air concentration
